# Baseline Project for Defect Views dataset

## Dataset
Your own dataset can be built by inheriting from the abstract class `CustomDataset` in `src.dataset.dataset`

## Config
```
"experiment_name": string,
"dataset_path": string,
"dataset_type": {`opt6`, `opt_bckg`, `binary`, `qplusv1`, `qplusv2`},
"dataset_splits": List[float] (1 for train/test (e.g. [0.8]), 3 for train/val/test),
"batch_size": int,
"epochs": int,
"crop_size": int (suggested 28),
"image_size": int (after crop, reshape can be applied),
"augment_online": List[str] (classes that undergo online augmentation),
"augment_offline": List[str] (classes that undergo offline augmentation),
"dataset_mean": List[float] (Grayscale/RGB),
"dataset_std": List[float] (Grayscale/RGB)
```

If ProtoNet is required, add a new fields "fsl":
```
"fsl": {
  "model": str {"default", "mlp", "cnn", "cnn105", "resnet50", "hrnet_w18", "vit_tiny_patch16_224", "cnncompare", "cnn105compare"},
  "episodes": int (suggested 100),
  "train_n_way": int,
  "train_k_shot_s": int
  "train_k_shot_q": int,
  "test_n_way": int,
  "test_k_shot_s": int,
  "test_k_shot_q": int,
  "model_test_path": Optional[str] (if defined, it runs the test only)
}
```

## Docker
If the use of Docker is required or desired, run the following two commands after installing Docker on the host machine:  
`$ docker compose build`  
`$ docker run --name <image_name> -v <host_path>:<docker_path> lollo/protonet`

The first command reads both the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `Dockerfile` in the main directory, so check them out and perform the necessary changes before running it.

The second command allows the mounting of the volume from the host machine to the docker container. In my case:   
- host path is `/media/lorenzo/M/datasets/dataset_opt/2.3_dataset_opt`
- docker path is `/media/` (in the docker [Linux] image)

This holds true if the dataset path specified in `config.json` is `/media/views/img`. In essence, you are mounting the **content** of `2.3_dataset_opt` folder into the docker's `/media` directory. Hence, it will finally contain the `views` folder with its subdirectories.
